this file reports on an exploratory descriptive analysis of the Chicago Crime public data set using SQL on Google Bigquery.
I created this project mainly to practice the techniques I've learned for data manipulation using SQL.
Feel free to try these queries for your self on bigquery!
I also visualised the results of some of these queries on Tableau. You can find the dashboard at:https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/daniel.mannah/viz/ChicagocrimeEDA/Story1

To determine the total number of reported crimes for each category, I used the following query (note that the column containing the crime category is called primary_type):
SELECT primary_type, COUNT(*) 
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
GROUP BY primary_type

Next, I used this query to find out the most common crime category for each year:

WITH rankings AS (SELECT year, 
primary_type, 
COUNT(primary_type) AS num_crimes, 
DENSE_RANK()OVER(PARTITION BY year ORDER BY COUNT(primary_type) DESC)
AS rank
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
GROUP BY year, primary_type
ORDER BY year DESC, num_crimes DESC)

SELECT year, primary_type, num_crimes
FROM rankings
WHERE rank = 1
ORDER BY year DESC

The arrest rate for each crime category was determined using this query:

SELECT primary_type,
 COUNT(primary_type) AS number,
 ROUND(AVG ( CASE WHEN arrest = true THEN 1
  ELSE 0 END), 2) AS arrest_rate
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
GROUP BY primary_type
ORDER BY arrest_rate DESC

I used this query to find out the most common locations for violent crimes to occur:

WITH violent_crimes AS (SELECT primary_type, COUNT(primary_type)
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
WHERE primary_type IN ('HOMICIDE', 'ROBBERY', 'BATTERY', 'DOMESTIC VIOLENCE') OR primary_type LIKE ('%ASSAULT%')
GROUP BY primary_type)

SELECT location_description, COUNT(primary_type) AS num_crimes,
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
WHERE primary_type IN (SELECT primary_type FROM violent_crimes)
GROUP BY location_description
ORDER BY num_crimes DESC
LIMIT 10

I also wanted to find out whether theres is seasonality to the number of homicides, i.e whether the amount depends on the time of year:

SELECT year, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM DATE) AS month, COUNT(primary_type) AS num_homicides
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
WHERE primary_type = 'HOMICIDE'
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month

Finally, I thought it would be interesting to find out how much time passes between homicides on average, and how this differed for each year:

SELECT year, ROUND(AVG(DATE_DIFF(date, previous_date, HOUR)),2) AS hours_between
FROM
(SELECT case_number, year, date, LAG(date, 1) OVER(ORDER BY date) AS previous_date
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime`
where primary_type = 'HOMICIDE'
ORDER BY date)
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year
